# Battleship

Program that enables a user to play Battleship in their terminal. It will play against
you, attempt to find your ship, and intelligently determine where other parts of your ship are.

Here is a link to a youtube video of 2 games being played (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY-5Qq6FjHw).

## Objective

* Sink the enemy ships before the enemy sinks yours.

## Gameplay Aspects

* Three Ships
1. Destroyer is a 2-grid ship that is potrayed by the letter D on your map.
2. Cruiser is a 3-grid ship that is potrayed by the letter C on your map.
3. Battleship is a 4-grid ship that is potrayed by the letter B on your map.
* Enemy can successfully find the remaining pieces of the ship once it hits once
* Map displays a "O" when either the player or enemy misses and displays a "X" when either the player or enemy hits a ship
* After a shot, chat logs will tell you if you hit a ship or missed and then tell you about the enemies shot
